# Chicago Crime Analysis
### A project for Honors Probability and Statistics

In this project, crime data during 2001-2025 from the city of Chicago is used to conduct a statistical analysis of crime trends. The data is obtained from the Chicago Data Portal and includes information on the type of crime, location, date, and time of occurrence.

We use boxplots and graphs, as well as confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression analysis to analyze the data.
